# Phoenix Cyboquatic Pilot District Specification

## 1. Site & Service Envelope
- Population served: ~50,000 residents (one sewer drainage district).[web:1]
- Estimated design flow: ~0.29 m³/s (≈500 L/person/day).[web:1]
- Existing assets: interceptors, nearby canal or outfall, candidate recharge basins within ADWR-regulated AMA.[web:2][web:20]
- Siting constraints: geotech suitability, utility corridors, minimal disruption to critical services.

## 2. Core KPIs

### Hydraulics & Safety
- No increase in sewer surcharge/backflow incidents vs. 3-year baseline.
- Module availability ≥ 90% over a full seasonal cycle.
- Structural safety: independent PE-stamped review and hazard analysis completed.

### Water Quality & MAR
- Treated effluent to recharge meets/exceeds ADEQ reclaimed standards and project-specific SAT entry criteria.[web:13][web:14]
- Demonstrated SAT performance:
  - Target reductions (order-of-magnitude): BOD/TSS to tertiary norms; significant N, P reductions; monitored CEC attenuation.[web:12][web:14]
- Confirmed absence of negative trends in nearby wells (nitrate, salinity, key CECs).

### Ecological & Thermal
- Measured recharge volume per year vs. design target (≈5.4×10⁶ m³/module/year).[web:20]
- Subsurface temperature shifts within acceptable band (no harmful geochemical/microbial effects).

### O&M & Economics
- Measured fouling rates and cleaning cycles in line with economic model assumptions.
- PAT/micro-turbine energy recovery in the 20–30 kW range without damaging hydraulics or biota.[web:52][web:69]

### Social & Governance
- Documented public engagement: baseline and post-pilot surveys, open houses, accessible explainers.
- Live data portal (flows, recharge, water quality summary) meeting transparency goals.
- Confirmed compliance: ADWR storage/ASR permits, CAP storage agreement (if CAP water used), ADEQ & EPA requirements.[web:3][web:6][web:20]

## 3. Phase 1 Research Focus

1. **Filtration & Fouling**
   - Long-term fouling curves for membranes under high FOG/dust loads; cleaning protocols and costs.[web:14]

2. **Bio-process Performance in Desert Climate**
   - Seasonal dynamics of reactor and air-biofilter microbiomes (temperature, dust, humidity effects).[web:40][web:12]

3. **SAT and CEC Fate**
   - Field-scale SAT performance for nutrients and a selected CEC panel; DO, pH, ORP as continuous predictors.[web:12][web:14]

4. **Real-time Sensing & DT Integration**
   - Validation of continuous sensors (flow, DO, turbidity, ORP, key surrogates) + periodic lab CEC sampling.
   - Integration into a district digital twin for scenario testing and operator training.[web:29]

## 4. Gating Criteria for Scale-Up

The pilot qualifies for replication only if:

1. **Hydraulic/Structural Gate**
   - No net degradation of sewer performance; PE-certified structural safety.

2. **Treatment/SAT Gate**
   - Stable compliance with agreed effluent and recharge quality targets over at least one full year.[web:13][web:14]

3. **Fouling/O&M Gate**
   - O&M intensity (labor, chemicals, downtime) within ±25% of pre-pilot economic projections.

4. **Social License & Governance Gate**
   - Positive/neutral net public sentiment, clear benefit understanding, and fully documented governance and data-protection plans.

If any gate fails, redesign and re-piloting steps are triggered before additional districts are authorized.
