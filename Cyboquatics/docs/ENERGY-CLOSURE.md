# Energy Closure

Cyboquatic deployments must satisfy energy-closure: power harvested, remediation achieved, and eco-impact remain within bounded, auditable budgets tied to Cybercore-Brain free-energy routing patterns.

Key constraints:

- Hydrokinetic power is computed from physical flow and capture geometry with explicit assumptions on density and efficiency.
- PFBS removal is modeled via mass-balance, and eco-impact scoring favors high-removal, low-disturbance regimes.
- QPU datashards export node profiles so higher-level governance stacks can route energy and compliance decisions across The Great Perplexity and the Great Orb.
