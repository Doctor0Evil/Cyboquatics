# Cyboquatics Design

Cyboquatics encodes non-biomechanical underwater recycling systems as particle-governed nodes with hydrokinetic power, PFBS removal, and eco-impact metrics.

Core components:

- `cyboquatic-core` Rust crate for deterministic hydro-power and remediation models.
- `CyboquaticPowerSimulator` C# CLI for scenario planning over coastal nodes.
- ALN particles for marine safety envelopes, power nodes, and telemetry profiles wired into Cybercore-Brain ingestion.

All fields and formulas are chosen to be audit-ready, energy-bounded, and explicitly constrained by marine-life envelopes.
